# PixelArt-Canvas
A pixelart Canvas to easily make pixelart

This is a project I made in my first few months of learning to program.
Its a browser page to make pixel art. It generates a grid letting you pick the size of the boxes and the amount of boxes.
It also gives you a few presets to help you choose.
If you need some inspiration you can use one of the examples.
